glScope: ALSA/OpenGL Oscilloscope

This is very a simple audio oscilloscope using OpenGL, GLUT, and ALSA.
Distributed under a completely free license; this means you can do
absolutely anything you want with this code. I'd appreciate if you
credit me where appropriate, though.


Controls are as follows: 

  Left mouse button:   Pan
  Mid mouse button:    Move trigger
  Right mouse button:  Scale
  Space bar:           Start/stop recording
  t:                   Toggle trigger mode (rising, falling, off)
  p:                   Print data
  Esc:                 Exit

When you print the plot data by pressing "P", two columns of text are printed 
to stdout. The first column is time, the second is amplitude. The easiest
way to capture this data to a file is via the command line: 

./glscope > data.csv


Since there is no interface to change the audio input device that is
displayed, you'll actually have to change some code if you want any
other channel besides the default recording device. The important line
in the code looks like this: 

pcm_name = strdup("plughw:0,0");

I guess you'll have to read about ALSA to figure out how to change 
that string.

Feel free to email me with any questions.

Additional controls...

q:     quit
1,2:   make line thinner, fatter
Tab:   move view so trigger is at right-hand side of screen
l:     toggle anti-aliased lines

Made arrow keys reversed direction from original
Right mouse button: made 4x less sensitive
Made line not blended, to make stand out more.
Set default trigger at t=0.



----- To Do:

* make the thing stop redisplaying when paused (still uses 100% CPU currently).

* make variable storage time
